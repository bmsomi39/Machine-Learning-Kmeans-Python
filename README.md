# Machine-Learning-Kmeans-Python

A simple K-Means Clustering model implemented in python. 

Load data1953,data2008 & dataBoth databases and modules (Numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot).
The class KMeans is imported from sklearn.cluster library. 
User defined number of clusters
The 'k-means' method to passed to the init argument to avoid the Random Initialization Trap.
The max_iter and the n_init were passed with their default values.
The clusters and controids are visualised in different colours using scatter plot and a legend is clarifies each data point and which cluster it belongs to.


  Output:
  Scatter plot with respective clusters and centroids of each cluster including a legend
  List of indices in each cluster
  Number of data points in each cluster
  List of countries in each cluster
  List of mean of Life Expectancy & Birthdate for each cluster
